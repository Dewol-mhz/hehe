        <p>
            kritika, first of all im truly sorry for not respecting your feelings and the trust we share.
            i will not defend myself, what i did was wrong. i understand how u  feel and why ur upset. 
            you come before any other girl, i value you and our relationship. i never wanted to hurt you,
            i just didnt think much ani etikai pathaideko, very stupid of me. i am committed to making things right and rebuild ur trust.
